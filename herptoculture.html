                Herpetoculture involves keeping, breeding, and caring for reptiles,amphibians and invertebrates in
                captivity. It emphasizes providing
                proper care by mimicking the animals' natural habitats as closely as possible. This includes offering
                the right diet, temperature, humidity, and lighting to help the animals thrive. Herpetoculture is about
                more than just owning these animals as pets; it's about understanding their behavior, biology, and
                environmental needs. Depending on the species, they can be "trained" to respond to specific triggers,
                showing that these animals are not just monsters. This hobby also contributes to conservation efforts. I
                believe this hobby creates a sense of an invisible "Noah's Ark," as millions of hobbyists worldwide
                collect and breed rare and beautiful animals. However, the hobby is not perfect and isn't for everyone.
                A major issue with the hobby is irresponsible owners. With the number of people worldwide keeping these
                animals, there is equally the threat of animals being released into the wild and becoming invasive
                species.

                I take care of a lot of animals.I grew up mainly surrounded by dogs and wanted nothing to do with other
                types of animals; I thought they
                were creepy and disgusting.
                It was not until I watched a YouTube video by <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDarkDen/featuredv"><em>The Dark Den</em></a> that I considered
                having other types of animals as pets.
                I fell in love with how he educated and took care of his animals in his videos, and thought <q>Why not
                    give it a try?</q>
                My brother and I then converted one of our rooms into a "reptile room" where all our animals are housed.
                The animals I currently have are used for educational purposes for my family and friends,
                to show that reptiles and other invertebrates can make great memebers of the family and are not just
                scary animals.
                My mother loves having her friends over and refers to the room as "The Zoo," and I love that I can show
                that other types animals are harmless creatures just like dogs.

        <h2>My Educational Animals</h2>
        <section class="picinborder">
            <p class="gabarito-font paragraphinborder">
                I define an animal as "educational" by how well it behaves and responds to people who are not the immediate keeper (me in this case). I have a variety of animals, meaning that at least one —and possibly the only —of each species is an educational animal under my care. That animal is then regularly handled and interacted with to have them more accustomed to interactions. This allows me to showcase the animal in a more controlled environment, reducing their stress and the risk of endangerment. However, this does not apply to every animal; some do not like being handled or are generally more aggressive than others.
