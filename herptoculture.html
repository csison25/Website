            <h2>What is Herptoculture?</h2>
            <p>
                I take care of a lot of animals.I grew up mainly surrounded by dogs and wanted nothing to do with other
                types of animals; I thought they
                were creepy and disgusting.
                It was not until I watched a YouTube video by <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDarkDen/featuredv"><em>The Dark Den</em></a> that I considered
                having other types of animals as pets.
                I fell in love with how he educated and took care of his animals in his videos, and thought <q>Why not
                    give it a try?</q>
                My brother and I then converted one of our rooms into a "reptile room" where all our animals are housed.
                The animals I currently have are used for educational purposes for my family and friends,
                to show that reptiles and other invertebrates can make great memebers of the family and are not just
                scary animals.
                My mother loves having her friends over and refers to the room as "The Zoo," and I love that I can show
                that other types animals are harmless creatures just like dogs.
