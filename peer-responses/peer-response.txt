    Suggestion #2 - Make the YouTube video open in a new tab, instead of the same page, so readers can 
    have both the YouTube video open and my webpage.
        This is on my herptoculture.html page, where I talk about how I got into reptile keeping
        Changes:
            Adding target="_blank" to the <a> tag
            Previous coded <a> tag: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDarkDen/featuredv"> 
            Changed <a> tag: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDarkDen/featuredv" target="_blank">
                Adding the target="_blank" has the link open on a new browser tab

    Suggestion #3: - I think this tab could use a little bit more spacing with the image, and the text below the header.
        Here he is referring to the image on my pinpong.html page. How I interpreted is that the image needs to have more
        spacing regarding to the text that surrounds it, so I think he means the text is getting too close to the image.
        So I added more margin/padding around the image to give it more space from the surrounding text. 
        Changes: 
            Previous CSS styling for the image: 
                #rulesimg { /*Floats this img to the left*/
                    float: left;
                    width: 40%;
                    margin-right: 3em;
                    margin-bottom: 2em;
                    min-width: 250px;
                }
            Changed CSS styling for the image: 
                #rulesimg { /*Floats this img to the left*/
                float: left;
                width: 40%;
                margin-right: 4em; /* larger margin here*/
                margin-bottom: 2em;
                min-width: 250px;
                }

                #intro {
                    margin-top: 2em;
                } /*Added this id to the section the image and <p> tag sit in, and made it even on both the top and bottom
                    of the section, for equal spacing*/

        Hey CJ, fantastic website! Everything is excellent; it's easy to read and navigate, and it was fun to explore. 
        The only issue I can really find is that the links are slightly hard to see against the pink background, but 
        besides that, two thumbs up!
        Changes: 
            Made the links easier to see by darkening the color, before it was a lavender purple-y color on the red-pink
            background. Now its a darker shade of blue. I also noticed that the set color I put on my <a href> also affected
            my links on the mobile nav menu, so I also made those links white to match the rest of the look for the mobile
            nav menu.
        I also implemented those changes when I read the comment, so I do not have a before-and-after of the change. But
        the original color is visible on his post on the Discussion board. 
            Changed code: 
                --link_color: rgb(0, 47, 201); This is on my structure.css page, which is the page I use apply a general
                styling to all the pages of the "Cj's Webpage" website.
