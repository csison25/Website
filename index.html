            <strong>Hello and welcome to my webpage!</strong><br>
            My name is Cj Sison and this webpage is about myself.
            I am 26 years old, I live in Bremerton and graduated from Central Kitsap High School.
            My first job was at the McDonald's in Silverdale.
            I have been working at Mcdonald's for 10 years and was a General Manager for the last 4 years.
            Some of you may know me or know of me as I used to run the McDonald's in Silverdale.
            Currently I am going to <a href="https://www.olympic.edu/" target="_blank">Olympic College</a> to further my
            education,
            getting my Associates degree in Software Development. Growing up I loved messing with technology and
            hope that one day I will take part in developing a video game.

            <p>
                I started playing ping pong in high school. After school, my brother and I would go to the Silverdale
                YMCA to study and hangout with friends. They conveniently had a ping pong table in the teen center and
                we thought why not give it a try? A big group of us played so much in the teen center the YMCA staff
                also started participating and allowed us to hold tournaments in the YMCA. Now I play in the Student
                Center at Olympic College whenever I have time.

            <h2 id="h2herpculture">Herpetoculturalist / Animal Educator</h2>
            <p> <!--Paragraph about animal keeping-->
                I take care of a lot of animals. Currently, I have <strong>17 crested geckos, nine tarantulas, two dogs,
                    a bearded dragon, and a leachianus gecko.</strong>
                I am one of those hobbyist, but I do it for more than just "collecting."
                I grew up mainly surrounded by dogs and wanted nothing to do with other types of animals; I thought they
                were creepy and disgusting.
                It was not until I watched a YouTube video by <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDarkDen/featuredv"><em>The Dark Den</em></a> that I considered
                having other types of animals as pets.
                I fell in love with how he educated and took care of his animals in his videos, and thought <q>Why not
                    give it a try?</q>
                My brother and I then converted one of our rooms into a "reptile room" where all our animals are housed.
                The animals I currently have are used for educational purposes for my family and friends,
                to show that reptiles and other invertebrates can make great memebers of the family and are not just
                scary animals.
                My mother loves having her friends over and refers to the room as "The Zoo," and I love that I can show
                that other types animals are harmless creatures just like dogs.

                <!--Picture of my dog-->
                <p>
                    This is Benji, he is 7 years old and has two different colored eyes.
                    One eye is brown and the other is blue.
                    He is a mix of four dog breeds: German Shepherd, Australian Shepherd, Jack Russel Terrier, and Chow
                    Chow.
                    He is super obedient and loves belly scratches.

                    This is Bubbles, he is 6 years old and is a mix of two dog breeds: Blue Heeler and Pit Bull.
                    Although a lot of people have their opinions of Pit Bulls, he is super loving and super motivated by
                    treats.
                    Infact, he needs a slow feeding bowl because he tends to swallow his food in big chucks as he eats.
