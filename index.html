                <strong>Hello and welcome to my webpage!</strong><br>
                My name is Cj Sison and this webpage is about myself.
                I am 26 years old, I live in Bremerton and graduated from Central Kitsap High School. I 
                have worked in McDonalds for 10 years and was a General Manager for the last 4 years.
                Some of you may know me or know of me as I used to run the McDonald's in Silverdale.
                Currently I am going to <a href="https://www.olympic.edu/">Olympic College</a> Getting
