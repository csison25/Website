                <h2>Herpetoculturalist / Animal Educator</h2>
                <p><!--Paragraph about animal keeping-->
                    I take care of a lot of animals. Currently, I have <strong>17 crested geckos, nine tarantulas, two dogs, a bearded dragon, and a leachianus gecko.</strong> 
                    I am one of those hobbyist, but I do it for more than just "collecting."
                    I grew up mainly surrounded by dogs and wanted nothing to do with other types of animals; I thought they were creepy and disgusting. 
                    It was not until I watched a YouTube video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDarkDen/featuredv"><em>The Dark Den</em></a> that I considered having other types of animals as pets. 
                    I fell in love with how he educated and took care of his animals in his videos, and thought <q>Why not give it a try?</q> 
                    My brother and I then converted one of our rooms into a "reptile room" where all our animals are housed. 
                    The animals I currently have are used for educational purposes for my family and friends,
                    to show that reptiles and other invertebrates can make great memebers of the family and are not just scary animals. 
                    My mother loves having her friends over and refers to the room as "The Zoo," and I love that I can show that other types animals are harmless creatures just like dogs.

                    <p>
                        This is Benji, he is 7 years old and has two different colored eyes.
                        One eye is brown and the other is blue. 
                        He is a mix of four dog breeds: German Shepherd, Australian Shepherd, Jack Russel Terrier, and Chow Chow.
                        He is super obedient and loves belly scratches.

                    <p>
                        This is Bubbles, he is 6 years old and is a mix of two dog breeds: Blue Heeler and Pit Bull. 
                        Although a lot of people have their opinions of Pit Bulls, he is super loving and super motivated by treats. 
                        Infact, he needs a slow feeding bowl because he tends to swallow his food in big chucks as he eats.
