                <h2>Herpetoculturalist / Animal Educator</h2>
                <p ><!--Paragraph about animal keeping-->
                    I take care of a lot of animals. Currently I have <strong>17 crested geckos, 9 tarantulas, 2 dogs, a bearded dragon, and a leachianus gecko.</strong> 
                    I am one of those hobbyist but, I do it for more than just "collecting."
                    I grew up mainly surrounded by dogs and wanted nothing to do with other types of animals, I thought they were creepy and disgusting. 
                    It was not until I watched a YouTube video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDarkDen/featuredv"><em>The Dark Den</em></a> that considered to having other types of animals as pets. 
                    I fell in love with how he educated and took care of his animals in his videos, and thought why not give it a try? 
                    My brother and I then converted one of our rooms into a "reptile room" where all of our animals are housed in. 
                    The animals I currently have are used for educational purposes for my family and friends,
                    to show that reptiles and other invertebrates can make great memebers of the family and are not just scary animals. 
                    My mother loves having friends over and refers to the room as "The Zoo," and I love that I am able to show that other animals are harmless creatures like dogs.
