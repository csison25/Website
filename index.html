            <strong>Hello and welcome to my webpage!</strong><br>
            My name is Cj Sison and this webpage is about myself.
            I am 26 years old, I live in Bremerton and graduated from Central Kitsap High School.
            My first job was at the McDonald's in Silverdale.
            I have been working at Mcdonald's for 10 years and was a General Manager for the last 4 years.
            Some of you may know me or know of me as I used to run the McDonald's in Silverdale.
            Currently I am going to <a href="https://www.olympic.edu/" target="_blank">Olympic College</a> to further my
            education,
            getting my Associates degree in Software Development. Growing up I loved messing with technology and
            hope that one day I will take part in developing a video game.

        <h2>My Mindset</h2>
        <p>
            My mindset is focused on constant improvement and learning through a variety of hobbies. I enjoy exploring
            different skills and interest because it challenges me to think in new ways and expand what I am capable of.
            I am the type who can never sit still. I am always looking for something new to do or learn. I believe that
            having hobbies gives an opportunity to grow, not just in skill but in character and
            perspective.

            <h3>Ping Pong</h3>
            <p>
                I've been playing ping pong since I was in high school. After school, my brother and I would go to the
                Silverdale
                YMCA to study and hangout with friends. Back in the day, the YMCA had a ping pong table in the teen
                center but, it was rarely ever used.
                So my friends and I decided to give the sport a try to pass time. <a href="pingpong.html">Read more</a>

            <h3>Animal Educator</h3>
            <p> <!--Paragraph about animal keeping-->
                Currently, I have <strong>17 crested geckos, nine tarantulas, two dogs,
                    a bearded dragon, and a leachianus gecko.</strong>
                I come off as one of those hobbyist, but I do it for more than just "collecting." I am very passionate
                about
                edcuating others about the joy of keeping and caring for exotic animals. <a

                <!--Picture of my dog-->
                <p>
                    This is Benji, he is 7 years old and has two different colored eyes.
                    One eye is brown and the other is blue.
                    He is a mix of four dog breeds: German Shepherd, Australian Shepherd, Jack Russel Terrier, and Chow
                    Chow.
                    He is super obedient and loves belly scratches.

                <p>
                    This is Bubbles, he is 6 years old and is a mix of two dog breeds: Blue Heeler and Pit Bull.
                    Although a lot of people have their opinions of Pit Bulls, he is super loving and super motivated by
                    treats.
                    Infact, he needs a slow feeding bowl because he tends to swallow his food in big chucks as he eats.
